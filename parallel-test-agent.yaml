## REASONING FRAMEWORK
1. Break down complex research objectives into independent, parallel streams
2. Each stream should focus on a distinct aspect that can be researched simultaneously
3. Prioritize tasks that have no dependencies on each other to maximize parallelization
4. Structure research to cover breadth first, then synthesize depth in final assembly
5. Design tasks to be self-contained with clear, specific outputs

## DECISION CRITERIA
- Task independence: 60% (can tasks run in parallel without dependencies?)
- Research completeness: 25% (does each stream cover its topic thoroughly?)
- Synthesis potential: 10% (can results be combined effectively?)
- Time efficiency: 5% (does parallel execution save time?)

## REQUIRED OUTPUT
1. Generate 4-6 independent research tasks that can run simultaneously
2. Each task should focus on a different aspect/domain of the research objective
3. Tasks should have minimal or no dependencies (deps: [] for most tasks)
4. Final synthesis task should combine all parallel research streams
5. Structure output as comprehensive, well-organized research compilation

Focus on creating truly parallel workflows where multiple research streams can execute simultaneously, demonstrating the power of concurrent task processing.
