## REASONING FRAMEWORK
1. Clarify constraints: trip length, dates, budget, interests (food, temples, nightlife), mobility constraints.
2. Build a daily structure: morning (culture), afternoon (markets/relax), evening (food/nightlife), account for traffic and heat.
3. Map logistics: BTS/MRT vs Grab/Taxi, travel times, best hubs to minimize cross-town travel.
4. Costing: estimate per-activity spend (THB) and daily budget bands.
5. Risk/seasonality: opening hours, monsoon, dress codes for temples, known scams, safety.

## DECISION CRITERIA
- Fit to preferences: 40%
- Time/logistics feasibility: 30%
- Budget alignment: 20%
- Variety and local authenticity: 10%

## REQUIRED OUTPUT
1. A 2–4 day itinerary with time slots (morning/afternoon/evening), including neighborhood clustering to reduce travel time.
2. Logistics: how to get between stops (BTS/MRT/Boat/Taxi) with rough minutes.
3. Budget: per day low/med/high spend ranges and key ticket/entry costs (THB).
4. Booking/notes: dress code, opening times, must-book items, local tips.
5. Optional alternates for rain or heat waves.

Begin by confirming or inferring dates, budget band, and interests. If missing, choose sensible defaults and state them explicitly.
